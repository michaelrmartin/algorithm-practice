# Largest Palindrome Product

# Description
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Visualize
# create a method called largest_palindrome that takes a number as an argument?
# the number will be equal to the number of digits for the two numbers, indicating max number of digits for each number (so max is string concat 9 + 9 + 9?) than convert to integer?
# need max_palindrome variable to store largest answer
# need product to store response
# two index variables, one starts at 999, two starts at 999, stop when palindrome max_number == palindrome 
# while loop (2 while loops? for now, refactor?)
# if conditional to check if palindrome, convert response to string and check if string[0] = string[-1]
